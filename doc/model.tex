\section{Notes}

For the purposes of this model,  stops (or actions) are simply any action or stop that could be performed.
This could be a `request' which comes from a customer and can only be a deliver, pickup, or replace action.
There are actions that aren't requests: like an action at a staging area, where a dumpster is left off at a staging area.
This means that for one staging area, there could be several different actions (or stops) that could be made.
A driver could pickup a dumpster or stage a dumpster which would be different \emph{actions} but would be at the same \emph{location}.
This will become more clear when we define our variables.

For convenience, unless otherwise noteged, 
$i$ will range from $1$ to $n$,
$j$ will range from $1$ to $m$,
$k$ will range from $1$ to $Y$,
$d$ will range from $1$ to $D$,
$t$ will range from $1$ to $|T|$,
and $l$ will be another index.
All times can be measured in seconds.

\end{tabular}

\subsection{Other thoughts}

There are a few more variables that may be worth considering.

\begin{tabular} { c | c | c }
  $f_{j,l}$                    & $  1 \le j, l \le m, f_{i,j} \ge 0                          $  & Distance, (or possibly fuel cost) between location $j$ to $l$ \\
  $T_{max}$                    & $  T_{max}   \ge 0                                          $  & Total time in a day. \\
                               & $                                                           $  &   Solutions that take more time are infeasible.   \\
  $F_l$                        & $  1 \le l \le L                                            $  & A fee associated with landfill $l$ \\
\end{tabular}

If we were to consider the last one, we would also need and index to associate each location to a landfill area.

In matlab, the parameters 
  $L$,
  $Y$,
  $R$
will be some of the parameters required to generate a random city in addition to several distribution parameters.
A city will be encapsulated by the rest.

The begin times and end times are possibly more general than needed.
However, this will allow us to let a given action happen at any time in the day, only mornings, or at specific time windows.
It was mentioned that the third option may be required for some customers.

There are $R$ different actions to represent the requests, because there is only one action associated to each.
Then each dumpster size will have its own action for each landfill, one action where the in and out size is each dumpster size.
Then, for each staging area, there will be actions allowing a dumpster to come in with no dumpster all leave with each dumpster size.
Also, there will be an action coming in to each staging area with each dumpster size and leaving with no dumpster.
That is, $n = R + (L + 2 Y) (|S| - 1)$.

\section{Decision variables}

The solution to the problem will be given by $D$ permutation vectors $x_d, 1 \le d \le D$.
Let us name their lengths $r_d := length(x_d)$.
We will interpret the $l$-th element of $x_{d}$ (which is denoted $x_{d,l}$) as the $l$-th stop to be performed by truck $d$.
For example, if $o_{x_{d,l}} = 'S'$, then the $l$-th stop by driver $d$ is a staging operation at a landfill.

\section{Objectives}

Let us make some of the following equations simpler with these definitions.
Let $d(x,y) = d_{x,y}$, so we have fewer subscripts.
For convenience of later sections, let us define a function $a(i, k)$ that represents the accrued time that truck $i$ takes to complete its $k$-th stop.
(We have assumed that $1 \le i \le D$, $1 \le k \le r_i$.)
This is given by:
$$a(d,l) := d(I, x_{d, 1}) + \sum_{j=1}^{l} W_{x_{d,j}} + \sum_{j=1}^{l-1} d(l_{x_{d,j}},l_{x_{d,j+1}} ).$$
That is, the time from the start location plus the times to travel between the stops, plus the time at each stop.

We will simulate this as a multi objective problem.
In revision one, this will only include the number of requests serviced along with the time taken to do so.
We could use a lexicographic ordering to order these (If we have a maximum time).

\subsection{Number of requests serviced}

The total number of requests serviced is either
$$N = (\sum_{d=1} ^D \sum_{j=1 \atop o_j \in \{\mbox{`D'},\mbox{`P'}\}}^{r_d} 1) + (\sum_{i=1} ^D \sum_{j=1\atop o_j = \mbox{`R'}}^{r_d} 2)$$
or
$$N = \sum_{d=1} ^D \sum_{j=1\atop o_j \in \{\mbox{`D'},\mbox{`P'}, \mbox{`R'}\}}^{r_d} 1$$
depending on whether servicing a replace request counts as twice the number of requests serviced as a pickup or delivery.

\subsection{Time taken to service requests}

One way to model the total time could be
$$ T_{total} = \max_{d=1} ^D \{ a(d, r_d) \} $$ which is the time of the longest route and would represent the amount of time before all routes were completed.
Another is to represent the total number of man-hours spent, which would instead be a sum of all times:
$$ T_{total} = \sum_{d=1} ^D  a(d, r_d)  .$$

It would be better to simply calculate the difference at each stop and its time window, 
and try to minimize the errors (or customer wait times/early inconveniences).
What the simulator will likely do is return an entire vector of time-costs associated with each driver.

If we also include fuel costs (or driving distances) between different locations, then another output will be the total distance driven.
Finally, if this is specifically fuel costs (and not driving distance) and we include the landfill fees, we could simply add the fees to driving costs and return it as an objective.

\subsection{Variances in output of dumpster sizes at each staging area}
This is future work, and might be used to ensure that dumpsters are equally (or otherwise) spread out among staging areas at the end of the day.
This might ensure that dumpsters at staging areas are accessible for the next day.
Also, it is mentioned in the problem description that some staging areas might not be allowed to have dumpsters overnight.
Although we would need another parameter in the model to dictage which staging areas these are, that would likely make this objective be a constraint.

\section {Constraints}

\subsection{Permutations must not overlap}
We don't want to visit the same request twice, so for all $1 \le d, d' \le D$ and all $1 \le j, j' \le r_i$, at least one of the following $4$ statements must be true:

%Should have used array or \[ ... \]


\begin{tabular}{ l r  c  l }
1: & $ d=d'$ & and & $j = j'$ \\
2: & $ o_{x_{d,j}}$ & $\in$ & $\{T, S, U\}$ \\
3: & $ o_{x_{d',j'}}$ & $\in$ & $\{T, S, U\}$ \\
4: & $x_{d,j}$ & $\ne$ & $x_{d', j'}$ \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Time for each stop falls within windows}
For each $1 \le i \le D$ and each $1 \le k \le r_i$ we need
$$ T^{begin}_{x_{i,k}} \le a(i, k) \le  T^{end}_{x_{i,k}}.$$

If we include the $T_{max}$ variable, we will need to ensure that $a(d,r_d) \le T_{max}$ for all $1 \le d \le D$

\subsection {Sizes match}

For all $1 \le d \le D$, and for all $1 \le j \le r_d - 1$, we have
$$S^{out}_{x_{d,j}} = S^{in}_{x_{d,j+1}}.$$
For all $1 \le d \le D$, we have
$$S^{in}_{x_d,1} = \mbox{`No Dumpster'} $$
as an initial constraint.

These mean that if a truck leaves a stop with a 9 dumpster, then he arrives at the next location with a 9x9 dumpster.
We also assume that all trucks start out with no dumpsters.

\subsection {Operations follow each other}
(Yes, this is needed! But wouldn't be if we instead used a dumpster state of full, or empty (which isn't the same as no dumpster) for each stop/action.
Then we would just need a `truck state matches' constraint, which would be as simple as the `sizes match' constraint.)

For all $1 \le i \le D$, and for all $1 \le j \le r_i - 1$, we need that $follows(o_{i, j}, o_{i, j+1})$ is true, where the $follows$ predicate has the following truth table:

\begin{tabular}{ c | c c c c c c }
 $follows$    & `D' & `P' & `R' & `T' & `S' & `U' \\
 \hline
 `D'          & F   & F   & F   & T   & F   & T   \\
 `P'          & T   & F   & F   & F   & T   & F   \\
 `R'          & F   & F   & F   & T   & F   & T   \\
 `T'          & F   & T   & T   & F   & F   & F   \\
 `S'          & F   & F   & F   & T   & F   & T   \\
 `U'          & T   & F   & F   & F   & T   & F   \\
\end{tabular}

Read this as operation in row $i$ can follow the operation in column $j$ if $follows(i,j) = $ T.

\subsection{Constraints on Truck Types}

For each $ 1 \le d \le D$ and each $1 \le j \le r_d $
we need $$ c_{x_{d,j},t_{d}} = 1 .$$


\subsection{Staging Area Capacities Met}

Let $b(d,t) $ ($b$ for bound) be the largest index $k$, $1 \le k \le r_i$ such that $a(d, k) < t$.
In other words, this is the a index into the $d$-th truck's route that gives its last stop before time $t$ ($t \in R$, $0 \le t < \infty $).

Then, we want that for each $1 \le y \le Y$, and each $s \in S \setminus \{\mbox{`No Dumpster'}\}$, and each $t \in R, 0 \le t < \infty $,

$$0 \le I_{y, s} 
 + \sum_{d=1}^D \sum^{b(d,t)} _{j=1 \atop { o_{x_{d,j}}  = \mbox{`U'} \atop   { S^{out}_{x_{d,j}} = s  \atop  s_y = l_{x_{d,j}}  }      }} (-1)
 + \sum_{d=1}^D \sum^{b(d,t)} _{j=1 \atop { o_{x_{d,j}}  = \mbox{`S'} \atop   { S^{in }_{x_{d,j}} = s  \atop  s_y = l_{x_{d,j}}  }      }} ( 1) \le C_i.$$
 
This assumes that each dumpster takes up the same amount of space in the staging area.
If not, we could use a weighted sum, where we replace the $\pm 1$ with a weight based on $s$
(the coefficients would need to be another parameter to the model).

\subsection{Each truck ends where it starts}
We may wish to add a constraint that says each truck must stop at the staging area it starts at.
That is, for all $1 \le d \le D$, we have $l_{x_{d, r_d}} = I$.

\section{Example}

Also, should add the variable names next to their descriptions.

\subsection{Solution}

These following two are possible solutions, although the second doesn't end where it starts.
1. $x_1 = ()$, $x_2 = ()$ (In this case, $r_1 = r_2 = 0$).
2. $x_1 = ()$, $x_2 = (6, 11, 4, 7)$ (In this case, $r_1 = 0$, $r_2 = 4$).

However, this solution is not feasible, because the sizes don't match in the last stop of the second truck:
$x_1 = ()$, $x_2 = (6, 11, 4, 8)$ (In this case, $r_1 = 0$,$ r_2 = 4$).

\subsection{Objectives}

The time for the first is $0$, which is also the number of requests serviced.
The number of requests serviced in the second is $1$, and the time for the second truck $a(2, 4)$ is:
$$d_{l_6,l_6} + W_6 + d_{l_6,l_{11}} + W_{11} + d_{l_{11}, l_4} + W_{4} + d_{l_4,l_7} + W_7$$
$$ = d_{2,2} + W_6 + d_{2,4} + W_{11} + d_{4, 2} + W_{4} + d_{2,2} + W_7$$
$$ = 0 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 $$
$$ = 12. $$
Thus, $T_{total} = 12$ as well.
