generate random solution
	make sure it is feasible


simulate
	null solution
	random solution
	0 requests serviced but allot of traffic between staging areas
	specific number of requests serviced
	0 serviced with several landfills
	0 landfills?
	0 yards
	
	have incorrect size
	have incorrect time

	have negative inventory
	have inventory over capacity
	have inventory over capacity in initial inventory (whether this belongs as a test to the simulate function or not, we should have it as a test.)

	repeated stop in same route
	repeated stop in different route
	repeated stop but it is only a staging area
	repeated stop but it is only a land fill








functions to write:
correct arguments (matrix sizes)

helper:
	matrix of times when each stop is serviced

constraints (return boolean):
	make sure no request is serviced twice
	verify that the operations follow each other
	verify that the sizes match from stop to stop (bigger can serve smaller!!!)
	count the inventory at each stop and make sure that it is within capacity and non-negative (somewhat harder to code than most other functions)
	function to return whether a truck ends where it starts (maybe won't be used)
	all action/truck type/operation constraints met

other:
	count the difference between the time that a truck is supposed to be at a stop and the time it actually is.


objectives:
	get total time for each driver
	count the number of requests that have been serviced
	get the total distance driven
	get the total number of fees
